In tmux, you cannot directly split a view across two different windows because each window is an independent entity with its own set of panes. However, you can achieve a similar effect by:

1. Splitting panes within the same window:  
   You can split a single window into multiple panes (horizontally or vertically) and run different sessions or commands in each pane.

   - Split vertically: `Ctrl+b %`
   - Split horizontally: `Ctrl+b "`

2. Using `tmux`'s "linked panes" or `tmux` panes that run the same process:  
   This allows you to view the same content in multiple panes, but not two completely different windows.

3. If you want to view contents of two windows side-by-side, you can combine the windows into panes within one window:

   - For example, you can move the content/commands you want from one window into a pane in the other window.

4. Using `tmux` `join-pane` or `break-pane` commands:

   You can move a pane from one window to another window or vice versa:

   - Move pane to another window:  
     ```bash
     tmux join-pane -s <source-pane> -t <target-window>
     ```

   This lets you gather panes from different windows into one window where you can split the view.

### Summary

- You cannot split a view directly between two separate windows, but you can split a single window into multiple panes.
- If you want to see what’s in two different windows side by side, you can move panes between windows to have both inside one window.
