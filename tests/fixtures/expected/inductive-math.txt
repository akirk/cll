Sure! Mathematical induction is a powerful technique used to prove statements about natural numbers.

Let's break it down into two main parts:

1. Base Case: First, you show that the statement is true for the initial value, typically n = 1.

2. Inductive Step: Then, you assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k (this is your inductive hypothesis), and you use that assumption to prove that the statement is also true for k + 1.

If both of these steps are successfully proven, you can conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers.

To make this more concrete, can you think of a specific statement or theorem you'd like to prove using induction?
