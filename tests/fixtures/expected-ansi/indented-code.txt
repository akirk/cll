In tmux, you cannot directly split a view [1macross two different windows[m because each window is an independent entity with its own set of panes. However, you can achieve a similar effect by:

1. [1mSplitting panes within the same window:[m  
   You can split a single window into multiple panes (horizontally or vertically) and run different sessions or commands in each pane.

   - Split vertically: [34mCtrl+b %[m
   - Split horizontally: [34mCtrl+b "[m

2. [1mUsing [34mtmux[m's "linked panes" or [34mtmux[m panes that run the same process:[m  
   This allows you to view the same content in multiple panes, but not two completely different windows.

3. [1mIf you want to view contents of two windows side-by-side, you can combine the windows into panes within one window:[m

   - For example, you can move the content/commands you want from one window into a pane in the other window.

4. [1mUsing [34mtmux[m [34mjoin-pane[m or [34mbreak-pane[m commands:[m

   You can move a pane from one window to another window or vice versa:

   - Move pane to another window:  
     ```bash
[90m     tmux join-pane -s <source-pane> -t <target-window>
[m     ```

   This lets you gather panes from different windows into one window where you can split the view.

[4mSummary[m

- You [1mcannot split a view directly between two separate windows[m, but you [1mcan split a single window into multiple panes[m.
- If you want to see what’s in two different windows side by side, you can move panes between windows to have both inside one window.
  
If you want, I can help with exact tmux commands to move panes/windows around!
